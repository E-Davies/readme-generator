# README Generator


## Usage 

Ensure you have node.js installed on your computer. To check open the Windows Command Prompt, Powershell or a similar command line tool, and type:
``` 
node -v
```
If you have node.js installed it will print a version number (e.g. v0. 10.35). Otherwise, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en) and download it (the recommended version to download is the LTS version).

Open the repo in VS Code and right click on the index.js file and select 'Open in Integrated Terminal'.

In the terminal, run the command:

``` 
node index.js
```

A series of questions about your README content will be presented in the terminal. Please type your answer to each question in the terminal and press enter. When presented with a list of choices, use the up & down arrows to selection an option and then press enter to select it.  

Once all questions have been answered, a README.md file will be created in the output folder.


> [!CAUTION]
> If you run the 'node index.js' command again in the integrated terminal, it will over write any current README.md file that may already exist in the output folder.




<!--A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the README generator must be submitted and a link to the video should be included in your README file -->
